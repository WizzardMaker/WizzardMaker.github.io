This is the Open Source remake of Airline Tycoon Deluxe.

It's a recreation of the game with improved support for every modern OS.
We aim to re-implement the game engine of Airline Tycoon. The original game files are needed to be able to use this remake. Our main objective is to re-implement the game logic and other needed code in open source code, which will serve as a base for future extensions or mods to the original.
